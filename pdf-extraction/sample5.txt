3.1 HTML5

This template uses HTML5 elements to aid in rep-
resenting the document structure. The section
element is used to split the text into sections, and
the header element holds the headlines. The
figure element is used to include figures and
their corrensponding captions live inside the fig-
caption element. The cite element holds all ref-
erences.

A small microformat, based on a convention of
class names, is used to encode the name and affili-
ation of the authors.

3.2 CSS

A CSS style sheet describes how to format the
HTML document into a PDF file. CSS is a declar-
ative language which attaches property values to
HTML elements and documents. Many aspects of
CSS is used to achieve the presentation of USENIX
papers, including:

¢ multi-column layout
¢ footnotes

* page and column floats
¢ multi-level counters

Some commonly used features are absent from
the above list: page numbers and running headers
should not be specifed by USENIX authors, these
are added by those who compile the Proceedings.

3.3 JavaScript

This template uses JavaScript to process refer-
ences. References are added at the point where
they appear, and a script is later used to move the

references to the end of the paper, leaving behind
a numeric marker.

3.4 PDF

(This section has been added by Hakon Wium Lie)

In order to convert the document to PDF, a for-
matter is needed. Common browsers support
HTML and CSS, but they do not support all the CSS
functionality for page-based formatting. For ex-
ample, browsers do not support footnotes or page
floats. This paper has been formatted with
Prince,” a purpose-built program for converting
HTML and XML documents into PDF by way of
CSS. Prince is a commercial product, but can be
downloaded and used for free for non-commercial
purposes.

In order for Prince to process the script includ-
ed in this template, a command line option must
be specified:

S prince --javascript example.html
