PROCEDURE:MRI - BRAIN WITHOUT CONTRAST

COMPARISON: Pampa Regional Hospital, CT, CT HEAD BRAIN W/O CONTRAST,
04/08/2020, 02:40 PM.

INDICATIONS: HEADACHE, SWELLING OF HEAD

TECHNIQUE:A variety of imaging planes and parameters were utilized for
visualization of suspected pathology in the brain. Images were performed.
“ thout geno linim contrast.. Motion artifact on numerous images compromises
the study.

FINDINGS:

CSF SPACES:Ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are appropriate for age. No
hydrocephalus, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or mass. .
CEREBRUM:Multiple small/punctate foci of abnormal T2 and FLAIR signal are seen
‘in the subcortical and periventricular white matter bilaterally. No mass,
hemorrhage or restricted diffusion is seen. .
CEREBELLUM:NO edema, hemorrhage, mass, acute infarction, or inappropriate
atrophy.

BRAINSTEM :NO edema, hemorrhage, mass, acute infarction, or inappropriate
atrophy. we ge ea .

SKULL:No mass or other significant visible lesion. . .
SINUSES:Limited views demonstrate no significant mucosal thickening or fluid.

OTHER: None.

CONCLUSION:Limited and compromised exam secondary to significant motion
artifact. Multiple small nonspecific foci of abnormal T2_ signal are seen in
the subcortical and periventricular white matter bilaterally consistent with
mild chronic small vessel ischemic changes.

INDICATIONS :PAGET’S DISEASE OF BONE

FINDINGS:

BONES:No fracture is seen. No medullary expansion or significant subchondral
lucency often associated with Paget's disease is identified. No bowing of the
tibia is noted, There does appear to be minimal subchondral lucency within the
mid to distal fibula which likely is associated with Paget's disease.

OTHER:No additional findings.

CONCLUSION:

1. No cortical thickening, bowling, or medullary expansion of the tibta often
associated with Paget's disease is identified. .
2. Minimal subchondral lucency is noted within the mid to distal fibula which
most likely is associated with Paget's disease,

PROCEDURE: MRFOOT WITHOUT CONTRAST [Left]

TECHNIQUE: Axial T1 fat-sat, proton density and T2 fat sat; coronal T1, proton density, T2 and T2 fat sat;
sagittal T1 and inversion recovery sequences were obtained of the left foot. Gadolinium was
administered intravenously and additional sagittal T1 fat sat, coronal T1 fat sat axial T1 fat
sat sequences were obtained.

COMPARISON: None.
INDICATIONS: TYPE 2 DIABETES WITH LEFT FOOT ULCER

FINDINGS:

Osseous structures: There is no fracture, marrow edema, destructive intraosseous lesion or periosteal elevation.
There is mild marginal osteophyte formation in the 1st metatarsal head with narrowing at the 1st metatarsal
phalangeal joint. Dorsal osteophyte formation is present between the talus and navicular. Mild osteophyte
formation is present between the navicular and the cuneiforms bones as well as between the cuneiforms bones and
their respective metatarsals.

Muscles and tendons: The extensor and flexor tendons are normal. There are diffuse fatty changes in the intrinsic
muscles of the foot.

Ligaments: The Lisfranc ligament is intact. The collateral ligaments at the metatarsal phalangeal joints are
normal.

Miscellaneous: Subcutaneous edematous changes are present over the medial and lateral ankle and in the dorsum
of the foot. There is no soft tissue mass lesion or abnormal fluid collection. Small ulceration is present in the soft
tissues along the plantar medial aspect of the 1st metatarsal.

CONCLUSION:

1. Small ulceration in the subcutaneous tissues along the plantar medial aspect of the 1st metatarsal.

2. Subcutaneous edematous changes over the dorsum of the midfoot and over the medial and lateral ankle
compatible with cellulitis.

3. Developing arthritic changes in the midfoot and 1st metatarsal-phalangeal joint.
