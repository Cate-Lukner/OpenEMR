Lukner Medical Clinic Patient Agreement for Long-term Opioid Therapy

 

1. 1,(PRIN agree that Dr. Lukner will be the only Physician
prescribing OPIOID (also known as NARCOTIC) pain medications for me and that | will obtain all of my
prescriptions for opioids at one pharmacy. The exception would be an emergency situation or in the unlikely
event that | run out of medications. Should such occasions occur, | will inform my physician as soon as possible.

2. Iwill take the medication at the dose and frequency prescribed by my physician. | agree not to increase the
dose of opioid without first discussing it with my physician. | will not request earlier prescription refills.

3. twill attend all reasonable appointments, treatments and consultations as requested by my physician. | agree
to other pain consultations/management strategies as necessary.

4. lunderstand that the common side effects of opioids therapy include nausea, constipation, sweating and
itchiness of the skin. Drowsiness may occur when starting opioid therapy or when increasing the dosage. | agree
to refrain from driving a motor vehicle or operating dangerous machinery until such drowsiness disappears.

5. lunderstand that using long-term opioids to treat chronic pain may result in the development of a physical
dependence on this medication, and that sudden decreases or discontinuation of the medication will lead to the
symptoms of opioid withdraw. | understand that opioid withdrawal is uncomfortable but not life threatening.

6. [understand that there is a high risk that | may become addicted to the opioids | am being prescribed. There is
also a high risk that someone (including family member, friends, and children) may try to take my medication
and that this is AGAINST THE LAW for me to give or sell my prescription medication to someone else.

7. If for some reason, | suspect that someone else took some of my medication, | will notify my physician. As such,
my physician may require that | have blood, urine or hair testing and /or see a specialist in addiction medicine
should a concern about addiction arise. Stolen medications will be replaced only when a police report is
provided.

8. lunderstand that the use of a mood-modifying substance. Such as tranquilizers, sleeping pills, alcohol or illicit
drugs (such as cannabis, cocaine, heroin or hallucinogens), can cause adverse effects or interfere with opioid
therapy. Therefore | agree to refrain from the use of all of these substances without prior agreement from my
physician.

9. Any evidence of ongoing high risk behavior (Hospitalization for drug overdose, positive drug screens for street
drug other than marijuana is an acute care setting, unsanctioned dose changes, obtaining opioid medication
from outside providers, pharmacy reports of prescription tampering or other aberrant behavior, etc.) will result

in termination of the Opioid Pain Management Agreement, and no further opioids will be provided by Dr.
Lukner.

10. | understand that | should check with my physician or pharmacist before taking other medications including
over-the-counter and herbal products.

11. | agree to be responsible for the secure storage of my medication at all times. | agree not to give or sell my
prescribed medication to any other person. Depending on the circumstances, lost medication may not be
replaced until the next regular renewal date.

12. Consent to open communication between my doctor and any other health care professionals involved in my
pain management, such as pharmacists, other doctors, emergency departments, etc.

13. | understand that if | break this agreement, my physician reserves the right to stop prescribing opioid
medications for me.
